* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

I learned a lot about the design of a website.  I had never considered that there should be a progression of how a user navigates the site.  After having read some of the articles about UX I will certainly pay more attention to every website I visit.  My opinion of web design was not positive at all a week ago.  It's still not very good but I am enjoying it more as I get better.  I look forward to getting better at design, who knows I could end up loving front end design by the end of all this.  Wireframing is ok, I have not done anything too in depth since I am limited in ability.  But I understand the need and importance of this stepin the design process.  I basically just set up a HTML template and started messing around a little bit.  What you see is the result of that.  For the moment, I am at the point where I need to just tinker around first get a vague idea of what is happening then read up and fine tune my knowledge.  My current knowledge of positions in CSS has improved much more now because I understand what is being said int he articles explaining it after having had some practice.  I would like to add a comment section to my site so that I can get feedback from anyone who visits the site.  I realize that this is not an HTML/CSS addition but I think it would be helpful in developing my site.  Positioning is the aspect I have had the most problems with.  I beleive I have improved my understanding but I still need to keep building things to solidify my knowledge.  I find that a lot of the slides that are used for learning make things confusing since it seems most of them were made to go alaong with a speaker of some kind.  I used http://creatingmywebsite.com/how-to-create-a-website-plan as a blueprint to create the plan for my site.
