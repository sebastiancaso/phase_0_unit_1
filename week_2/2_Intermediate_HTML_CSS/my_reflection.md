# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
-Web standards are a good way to streamline the way people design and build websites.  It makes for universal understanding by anyone reading the code.
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
- The standard structure makes sense in regards to the HTML tags I have used i.e header,p,div,footer.  I do not understand the need for section,aside or nav tags.  I also do not understand the semantic vs non-semantic portion of the GDI slides.  
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
- I like the new HTML5 elements because it makes it easier for me to understand and visualize how the HTMl is being set up.  I am not sure if this would be the case for everyone.  For people who have a very good grasp on HTML they may find it unnecessary and just extra information to have to code.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
- reset.css is a method of creating uniformity for CSS documents in various web browsers.  It makes styling a page for all types of browsers easier.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
-I use IE at work, and gchrome at home and I used to use firefox.  I have not noticed a difference in browsers rendering of web pages mainly because I use IE to run SAP at work and rarely surf the web on my work computer.  I just checked the difference between SI.com on firefox and chrome.  The only difference that I noticed was the text on firefox was slightly larger and appeared to be more bolded than chrome.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I used http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/getting_started/article.php/3479511#howdo to understand creating links to different sections of the same web page.  I also found a nice article explaining CSS reset http://www.cssreset.com/what-is-a-css-reset/.  


I find that the resources provided each section are somewhat hit or miss for me.  Some of the resources are very dry and technical and overcomplicate what is being taught.  This is not the case for all resources just a few.  As a resul I generally search for other articles related to the topic to better understand what I am reading.  I had no idea what reset CSS was, after reading more about it, I understand the thought behind using it and also why some people are against using it.  I enjoyed learning to the the jump between sections in a page, that was a useful tidbit to learn.  I still need to get better with HTML and CSS, I imagine the solo challenge will give me ample opportunity to improve my understanding.  I liked editing the women in computing webpage.  I did not find anything particularly annoying in this exercise.
