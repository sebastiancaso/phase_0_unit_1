# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?


My biggest challenge with phase 0 in regards to time is making sure I effectively use my time correctly.  I noticed that in week 1 I worked really hard and for a long time  but I don't think I worked smart.  I rushed to finish the exercises as quickly as possible and did not think much about making sure I understood what I was doing.

I will combat that by maing sure I review the work for the week on Sunday.  From there I will be sure to budget my time to ensure that I can accomplish the objectives in a manner that maximizes my learning instead of just ensuring that I finish the objectives.

I liked the Pomodoro technique I think I will give that a try for week 3.  The big advantage of learning this technique is to accurately budget your time.  I beleive that honing this skill will make juggling phaseo 0 and my work responsibilities much easier.  The benefit from this will be that I will not feel rushed or pressured to just complete the work  I will have enough time to let the lesson sink in and be sure that I truely grasp the concepts and ideas from the lessons.

My plan for the rest of phase 0 will be to budget time for the week on Sunday night.  The overall goal is to not only complete the assignments for the week, but also leave time for me to review old subjects.  Being able to review old subjects or delve into new ones at the end of a week will cement and expand my knowledge much more quickly.
