Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?



This was a very time consuming process.  I believe this was the case because I have never really analyzed a website before.  I think it was a productive learning experience in that I was able to use HTML and CSS more and it gave me a new perspective on viewing a webpage.  I did not feel particularly good or bad about this exercise.  I do not feel comfortable enough with my knowledge of HTML and CSS at this point.  I will most likely make changes and refine this page to solidify my knowledge.
