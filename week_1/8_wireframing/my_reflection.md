## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I learned a great deal about both subjects.  The process of determining the problem and solving it was very interesting to read.  creating a wireframe was fun the website I used was mockflow.com.  It was a very easy user-friendly set up that allowed me to start creating my wireframes instantaneously. I learned the thought process behind designing a site.  Wireframing as I understand it is the HTML equivalent of pseudo-coding in ruby, which will be very hepful going forward.  I feel that I have a good grasp on wireframing and look forward to using it more in the future.  I enjoyed using workflow.com to wireframe, I found the wikipedia site on design thinking to be difficult to read, it did not keep me interested.
