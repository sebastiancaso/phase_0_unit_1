## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that the internet is not the web.  I also learned that domain names are essentially just nicknames for IP addresses.

In order to put any type of media on your webpage you must know the correct tags to be used.  Also, all that is necessary to build a website is HTML.

It was great to get a very basic idea of how we see what we see on a webpage.

The explanation of the web versus the internet was interesting.  I was always a bit confused by some people saying the internet was created by the US military but Tim Berners-Lee invented the web.
