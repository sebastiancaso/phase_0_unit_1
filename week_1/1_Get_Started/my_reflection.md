## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience.
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

The install of git went smoothly, no real problems there.  Installing GitHub was a breeze as well.  However initially understanding what I was looking at took me awhile.

Git is a program that allows you to take snapshots of changes made to files on your computer(i.e adding text, editing a spreadsheet).  This allows you to make controled changes as well as to revert back tp previous versions.  GitHub is a website that allows you to store these files and snapshots online.  This allows numerous people to work on the same file and show each other the changes they have made. 

Version control is recording changes made to your code and creating new versions that can be changed.  This allows much greater flexibility when trying to come up with solutions to problems as you can make as many changes as you want (as long as you commit) and still go back to different points in your project.

I believe version control allows a developer to experiment more with their code and solutions.  It allows more boldness as you know that if it all falls apart you can go back to safe point in the project.

I understand the need for version control in programming otherwise every project would have many different versions saved without any type of way of seeing the difference in versions or integrating certain changes while leaving out others.  I need to work on feeling more comfortable with git commands.  For example, I am not quite sure the difference between revert and reset.
