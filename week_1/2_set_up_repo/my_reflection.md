## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


A repository can be created on GitHub by going to your home page and selecting the create new icon next to your avatar in the top right of the screen.  After selecting 'create repository' you need to name the repository, decide if you want it to be accesible to the general public or keep it private and choose a license (if necessary).  You then click the create repository button and you are finished.

Open source is a way of developing software.  Instead of restricting access to source code, it is freely available to be used according to its license.  This allows many different features or ideas to be implemented from an original idea.  

Open source seems like it is a great idea.  It allows everyone to share their ideas and creativity, which is almost always a good thing.  The only draw back is that it is possible for your original idea to be completely lost in the evolution of a project.

Using licenses is very important to protect yourself and your projects.  It allows you to have a say on how an idea can or will be used.  The best part of a license is there are many to choose from which allows you to customize how a project can be used.

The concept of a software license and the differences between them was very interesting.  There was nothing too difficult to understand, the license explanation on http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/24/a-short-guide-to-open-source-and-similar-licenses/ did a good job of breaking down what exactly each clause meant.
