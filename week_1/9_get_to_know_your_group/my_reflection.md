Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

It seems most everyone is scared or worried in some way or another about DBC.  It makes me feel better knowing that other people are doubting themselves.  My experience this week has shown me that I will need to commit more time than anticipated to the prep material.  I had been learning straight Ruby in preparation for Phase 0 and had no knowledge of HTML or CSS.  I am definitely going to need to put in a lot of work.  If it continues like this I may need to quit my job earlier than anticipated so I can apply myself in the fashion that is needed to succeed.
