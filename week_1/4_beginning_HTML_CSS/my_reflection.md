## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think the structure of HTML is very logical which made picking up the basics pretty quick.  Formatting text does not seem to be necessary as you could just emphasize the same thing through CSS.

HTML seems pretty straight forward, the structre is basic which will make it easy to pick up quickly.  

Learning how to post a link or an image or an image that is a link was very interesting.  I liked that I now know why some links will open in a new page/tab and some do not.

I looked up some information on http://www.w3schools.com/.
