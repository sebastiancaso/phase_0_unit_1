// My role in the group is: Person 2 (Robert Schwartz and Sebastian Caso)

// Here is my part of the challenge:
/*our assumption is we are given the numbers and don't need to create a new array*/

// 
// #pseudocode
// create variable called total which is equal to 0
// loop through the number array (which was given to us) 
// pass the number array to a block which will add all the numbers

// 
// #pseudocode
// Create new variable named mean 
// Have it equal to total / length of the array 

// 
// #pseudocode 
// First put the array in order 
// then find the length of the array
// then divide by 2 
// if even, subtract 1 and use that number to call that location in the array.
// if there's a remainder, round down and use that number to call the location in the array.
